## Investigating the distribution of _some_ (but not _all_) implicatures using corpora and web-based methods

This repository contains the dataset and the R code for generating the figures and replicating the analyses reported in 

Degen, J. (2015). Investigating the distribution of _some_ (but not _all_) implicatures using corpora and web-based methods. _Semantics & Pragmatics_ 8(11), pp. 1-55.

You will find the dataset under **data** and the R scripts in **rscripts**. The file figures_and_analysis.R contains the main code, but it uses functions defined in helpers.R.
